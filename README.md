Metanyms is a small project, presented as a code challenge and built over the course of two days, that allows a user to search for a word in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Thesaurus and see a short definition and a list of its synonyms. Each word in the list can be clicked, displaying the definition and synonyms of that word.
